# How to get into nvim quick

## Before you use nvim
First, use VSCode with the [nvim plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim).
If you need help setting it up in Windows with WSL, [look here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6PTNxrTWVU).

## Setup nvim
[kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) is the best `sane base setup` for nvim.
[lazyvim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) is a great alternative, that I now use. Also `sane`, but less minimalistic.

## Learn nvim
[The Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6AR2RMB5tE&list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R) will have you go step by step until you can't stop.
